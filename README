# mate.js - TextMate Utilities for CommonJS Programming

mate.js is a set of utilities that make it easier to write CommonJS code with
TextMate.  This is early in development but currently there is:

## seed mate 

"seed" plugin will automatically locate one or more packages and open them in
TextMate.  Just type:

	seed mate package_foo package_bar
	
You can also name paths, in which case the tool will walk up the chain and 
find a nearest package to open.

## NOT YET IMPLEMENTED

Here are some other cool ideas to implement:

## mate#install

This module can be invoked to automatically install a TextMate bundle from 
within your package.  Just invoke it like so:

var mate = require('mate');
mate.install('path/to/bundle');

This will copy the bundle to the proper location then tell TextMate to reload
its bundles.

Seeds can use this in their install script to add bundles automatically.


## mate TextMate Bundle

Port over CommonJS-aware jslint tool - run it automatically.  Include some 
shortcuts, etc.
